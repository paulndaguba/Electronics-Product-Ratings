# Electronics-Product-Ratings
The goal was to visualize the data, define key indicators, find insights, and define calculations and metrics by answering the following questions:
1. What is the relationship between product ratings and recommendation status?
2. Which brands have the highest average customer satisfaction, and how does it vary across different product categories?
3. How do product features (like color or dimensions) influence reviews and ratings?

Tool Used: Power BI

The Onyx Data challenges are organized for data analysts worldwide to showcase their data analysis and visualization skills, have fun, and earn professional recognition. 
Personally, another reason these challenges are organized is for continuous learning. 
So while working on this project, I learned about the Switch Function and the Group By Function in Power BI. 
The switch function is just like the IF/ELSE statement, and I used it to create a bucket rating. 
And the Group By Function I used in grouping all categories into different categories of their own. 
I also learned how to use the star rating, which I imported from Power BI.
